        <h3>Dont waste your precious time and resources, without knowing you have supporters</h3>
        <p>Prebetas allows you to share your idea with the world, and secure users before you have even finished development.
        this helps avoid work on a project that isnt as appealing as you thought, of sets you up for more rapid success if it is. 
        Week one user count is a huge indicator of success and also is a great assest to elicit funding. </p>
